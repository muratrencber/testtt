            <h2>PERT and Gantt Charts</h2>
            <p>To visualize the project timeline and dependencies, a PERT chart and a Gantt chart have been developed. These charts detail the sequence of project activities, their start and end dates, and the interdependencies between tasks.</p>
            <h2>Critical Path</h2>
            <p>The critical path for the project has been identified to ensure that the project is completed on time. The critical tasks are those that, if delayed, would delay the entire project. The critical path analysis will be used to monitor project progress and prioritize task completion.</p>

            <h2>Monitoring and Adjustments</h2>
            <p>The project schedule will be monitored closely, with regular status meetings to ensure that all tasks are on track. Adjustments to the timeline will be made as necessary in response to any deviations from the planned schedule or unexpected project risks.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The project schedule is built to be robust yet flexible, allowing for adjustments as needed while ensuring that the project moves forward towards successful completion within the designated timeframe.</p>
